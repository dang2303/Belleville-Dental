              <p>Slight pain: After the effect of the anesthetic wears off, you may feel some discomfort at the extraction site. Your doctor will prescribe pain relievers to make you more comfortable. Usually, the pain will subside after 48 hours.</p>
              <p>Bleeding: After wisdom tooth extraction, Elite Dental always advises patients to bite down on cotton for 30 minutes to help stop bleeding. Within the first 24 hours, you may notice some blood oozing with saliva to form a pink solution. Rest assured that this is completely normal.</p>
              <p>Swelling: In some cases where wisdom tooth position is difficult and complicated, after tooth extraction, there may be slight swelling in the cheek area, lasting for 3-5 days. If after 5 days, swelling increases along with pain, please contact Elite Dental immediately to make an appointment for a check-up and follow-up with the Doctor.</p>
              Difficulty opening the mouth: After tooth extraction, the swollen corner of the jaw will stimulate the biting muscle to cause muscle contraction. Therefore, for the first few days, you may find it a little difficult to eat, chew, and communicate. After a few days, this will quickly decrease and disappear.</p>
